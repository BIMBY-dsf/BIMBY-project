# **About the Butterflies in my Backyard (BIMBY) Project**

BIMBY is a Community Science Project that seeks to raise public awareness of butterflies of Canada and their protection. BIMBY 2024 launched our new season in May. BIMBY Seekers joined the general training in May and two iNaturalist trainings the some month.

We have close to 900 Seekers from across Canada. BIMBY Seekers are trained to submit photos of butterflies and the plants they rest on. Seekers are also encouraged to add other related information about the condition of the environment the butterflies were observed.

Seekers' observations will be captured here automatically and help scientists formulate policies to help protect butterflies in Canada.

PS - For BIMBY Seekers, all the related information about the project is moved to the JOURNAL Section of BIMBY Project on iNaturalist. The Journal section will be updated regularly throughout the 2024 Season.

**About this Repository**

This repository is used by the BIMBY committee to collaborate, plan, track and store updates, code, and queries used to maintain and update the reporting database. The repository and project is currently set to private. This is to change in the future once a bit more organized.

To view the Project To-Do list, go to **Projects > Data Planning** to add, edit, or view your teams tasks.

# **Github Basics**

To get started, create a GitHub Account.
The BIMBY-project repository acts as a shared project documentation location that all admin users can update and provide access to documentation for interested members of the public.

Download GitHub Desktop and close the repository to a local computer drive. Working within the local drive you can save, edit, or create new files, and once ready, "push" or publish them to the Git project for other users to access. If you prefer, you can also work with command prompt/terminal to create folders, stage, commit and push changes from your local drive back to the Github repository.

Forked repositories should only be used for database coding that is in test or development stages if there will be interruptions to the reporting or use of the database.

**Using GitHub Desktop**

With a cloned repository set up on your local drive, Github Desktop automatically tracks changes you make to the local repository, include changed files, new folders etc. Once you are ready to share your changes, open GitHub Desktop, and you'll see a list of changes its captured. Check the changes you want to see on Git, then add a title to the summary, and click Commit to main (or to the forked branch if/when we get there). Then click "Push" to have these changes appear on the online repository.

To keep up with changes others have made to the online repository to your local drive, in GitHub Desktop click "Pull Origin".
