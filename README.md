# **About the Butterflies in my Backyard (BIMBY) Project**

BIMBY is a Community Science Project that seeks to raise public awareness of butterflies of Canada and their protection. BIMBY 2024 launched our new season in May. BIMBY Seekers joined the general training in May and two iNaturalist trainings the some month.

We have close to 900 Seekers from across Canada. BIMBY Seekers are trained to submit photos of butterflies and the plants they rest on. Seekers are also encouraged to add other related information about the condition of the environment the butterflies were observed.

Seekers' observations will be captured here automatically and help scientists formulate policies to help protect butterflies in Canada.

PS - For BIMBY Seekers, all the related information about the project is moved to the JOURNAL Section of BIMBY Project on iNaturalist. The Journal section will be updated regularly throughout the 2024 Season.
